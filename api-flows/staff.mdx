# Staff API Flow

This flow describes how a staff members handle orders in the Kitchen Delivery System (KDS).123

## 1. Display orders

### Request

The client sends an HTTP request to the `orders` endpoint to retrieve a list of orders. This example shows a request for orders that are ready for pickup and have a priority of 1.

```
curl -X GET "{{baseURL}}/orders?filter=status.eq~Ready%20for%20Pickup|priority.eq~1"
```

If the request is successful, the server responds with a `200 OK` status code. The response body contains each the orders you specified, along with their dish IDs, patron name, status, and priority.

```
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "681e38bfc19ebac4a9142549",
      "name": "Burnice",
      "table_number": null,
      "status": "Ready for Pickup",
      "priority": 1,
      "dish_ids": [
        "681e38bfc19ebac4a914252e",
        "681e38bfc19ebac4a91424ec",
        "681e38bfc19ebac4a9142512"
      ],
      "special_requests": null,
      "created_at": "2024-07-04T16:46:14.137Z",
      "updated_at": "2025-05-09T11:45:28.184Z",
      "scheduled_at": "2026-04-10T03:06:18.810Z"
    }
  ],
  "total_results": 1
}
```

## 2. Prioritize orders

### Request

The client sends an HTTP request to the `orders/{id}`endpoint, containing the order ID. This allows the expeditor to adjust the priority of the order from 1 to 5, with 1 being the highest priority. The example below sets`priority` to `1`.

```
curl -X 'PUT' \
   '{{baseURL}}/orders/681e38bfc19ebac4a9142544' \
   -H 'Authorization: Bearer fcb0d3f1-0077-430c-b84f-c1cddc1d048b' \
   -H 'accept: application/json' \
   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   -d '{
      "name": "Trace",
      "table_number": 19,
      "status": "Ready for Pickup",
      "priority": 1,
      "dish_ids": [
        "681e38bfc19ebac4a91424c3",
        "681e38bfc19ebac4a91424fa",
        "681e38bfc19ebac4a9142520",
	"681e38bfc19ebac4a91424c9"
      ],
      "special_requests": null,
      "scheduled_at": null
      }'
```

### Response

If the request is successful, the server responds with a `200 OK` status code. The response body contains the order ID and an updated `priority`of `1`.

```
{
  "id": "681e38bfc19ebac4a9142544",
  "created_at": "2024-05-23T06:21:08.754Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-06-23T00:13:33.678Z",
  "scheduled_at": null,
  "table_number": 19,
  "status": "Ready for Pickup",
  "priority": 1,
  "dish_ids": [
    "681e38bfc19ebac4a91424c3",
    "681e38bfc19ebac4a91424fa",
    "681e38bfc19ebac4a9142520",
    "681e38bfc19ebac4a91424c9"
  ],
  "special_requests": null
}
```

## 3. Initiate preparation

### Request

Now that the order is prioritzed, the expeditor can initiate the preparation of the order by setting the order status to `In Progress`. The client sends an HTTP request to the `orders/{id}`endpoint.

```

curl -X 'PUT' \
   '{{baseURL}}/orders/681e38bfc19ebac4a9142544' \
   -H 'Authorization: Bearer fcb0d3f1-0077-430c-b84f-c1cddc1d048b' \
   -H 'accept: application/json' \
   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   -d '{
      "name": "Trace",
      "table_number": 19,
      "status": "In Progress",
      "priority": 1,
      "dish_ids": [
        "681e38bfc19ebac4a91424c3",
        "681e38bfc19ebac4a91424fa",
        "681e38bfc19ebac4a9142520",
	"681e38bfc19ebac4a91424c9"
      ],
      "special_requests": null,
      "scheduled_at": null
      }'
```

### Response

If the request is successful, the server responds with a `200 OK` status code. The response body contains the order ID, along with the updated status.

```
{
  "id": "681e38bfc19ebac4a9142544",
  "created_at": "2024-05-23T06:21:08.754Z",

    "681e38bfc19ebac4a91424c9"
  ],
  "special_requests": null
}
```

## 4. Order preparation by station

### Request

Each dish is assigned to a specific station (e.g., cold, hot, beverages). Stations responsible for each dish see their respective parts of the order on their KDS. The client sends an HTTP request to the `order/{id}/dishes `endpoint, filtering the response to only include dishes that belong to specific `station`.

```
curl -X GET "{{baseURL}}/orders/681e38bfc19ebac4a9142544/dishes?filter=station.eq~hot"

If the request is successful, the server responds with a `200 OK` status code. The response body returns the orders with a `station `of `hot`.
