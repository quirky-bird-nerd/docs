# Patron API Flow

This flow describes how a patron browses through the app and places an order from the menu.

## 1. Select a food category

### Request

The client sends an HTTP request to the `dishes` endpoint and retrieves a list of dishes for the selected food category tab. In the following example, the user selected the Appetizers tab.

```
curl \-X GET "{{baseURL}}/orders?filter=status.eq~Ready%20for%20Pickup|priority.eq~1"
```

### Response

If the request is successful, the server responds with a `200 OK` status code. The response body contains each dish and its details, including the IDs of each ingredient.

## 2. Check ingredient quantities

### Request

The client sends an HTTP request to `ingredients` endpoint, containing the ingredient ID. This allows the app to check if there are enough ingredients to create the dish. Fields for `in_stock_qty` and `name` are included.

### Response

If the request is successful, the server responds with a `200 OK` status code. The response body contains the ingredient ID, name, and in-stock quantity.

## 3. View dish details

### Request

The client sends an HTTP request to the `dishes`endpoint, containing the dish ID.

### Response

If the request is successful, the server responds with a `200 OK` status code. The response body contains the dish name, ID, prep time, and ingredients.

## 4. Add dishes and view cart

The patron adds dishes and views them in their cart.

## 5. Place an order

### Request

The client sends an HTTP request to `orders`endpoint. Make sure to include your base URL, bearer token, and dish IDs. Multiple dish IDs can be separated by commas.

### Response

If the request is successful, the server responds with a `201 Created` status code. The response body contains the new order ID, when the order was created, status, priority, dish IDs, and any special requests.

## 6. Confirm the order

The patron receives a confirmation of the order and the details are sent to the restaurant staff so they can prepare the order.
